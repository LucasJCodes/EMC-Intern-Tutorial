// C++ is even more complicated than Fortran
#include <iostream> // this is to get the std::cout
#include <string> // this is to get the string type

int main() {
  std::string myname = "Lucas Jones";
  std::string myemail = "lucas.jones@noaa.gov";
  std::cout << "Hello world! My name is " << myname << " and my email address is "
  << myemail << "." << std::endl; // semicolon means the statement is done, otherwise it is one big line
} // C++ loves brackets...
